# SSCV Use Cases

This document outlines practical applications of the System Security Context Vector (SSCV) framework across different industries and organizational contexts.

## 1. Vulnerability Management & Prioritization

### Traditional Challenge
Security teams receive hundreds of vulnerability alerts daily, most prioritized only by CVSS scores. A CVSS 9.0 vulnerability might get immediate attention even if it's on an air-gapped development system, while a CVSS 6.0 on an internet-facing production server gets deprioritized.

### SSCV Solution
**Implementation**:
```
Development System: SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:A/AC:F/EP:A/DL:I/PS:C
CVSS 9.0 → CRS 2.03 (Low Priority)

Production Server: SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:E/AC:F/EP:A/DL:C/PS:C  
CVSS 6.0 → CRS 6.75 (Medium Priority)
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces alert fatigue by 60-80%
- Focuses resources on actual business risk
- Improves patch deployment timeline for critical systems
- Enables risk-based SLA definitions

## 2. Compliance & Audit Reporting

### Traditional Challenge
Auditors and compliance frameworks often require evidence of risk-based decision making, but CVSS scores don't reflect actual organizational risk posture.

### SSCV Solution
**Documentation Framework**:
```
System: Customer Database Server
CVSS Score: 8.5 (High)
SSCV: SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:I/AC:Z/EP:M/DL:C/PS:C
Contextual Risk Score: 2.8 (Low)

Risk Acceptance Justification:
- Zero-trust access controls implemented
- Managed SOC monitoring active  
- Current patches applied
- Internal network segmentation
```

**Compliance Benefits**:
- SOC 2: Demonstrates systematic risk assessment
- ISO 27001: Supports risk treatment decisions
- PCI DSS: Justifies compensating controls
- NIST CSF: Aligns with risk management processes

## 10. Enterprise IT Infrastructure Assessment

### Traditional Challenge
Enterprise IT teams struggle to prioritize vulnerabilities across diverse infrastructure components. A database server, web application, and file server might all have the same CVSS score but represent vastly different actual risks to the organization.

### SSCV Solution
**Common IT System Assessment**:
```
Public-Facing Web Server:
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:E/AC:F/EP:A/DL:M/PS:C
CVSS 8.0 → CRS 5.3 (Medium)
Rationale: External exposure increases risk despite good security controls

Internal Database Server:
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:I/AC:Z/EP:M/DL:C/PS:C
CVSS 8.0 → CRS 2.7 (Low)
Rationale: Strong access controls and internal network significantly reduce risk

Legacy File Server:
SSCV:1.0/OS:O/NE:I/AC:B/EP:B/DL:I/PS:D
CVSS 8.0 → CRS 4.0 (Medium)
Rationale: Outdated OS and delayed patches increase contextual risk

Development Environment (Conservative Assessment):
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:I/AC:F/EP:A/DL:I/PS:C
CVSS 6.5 → CRS 1.3 (Low) with 20% threshold
CVSS 6.5 → CRS 2.17~ (Low) with 33% threshold per policy
Rationale: Organization uses higher threshold for development systems
```

**Enterprise IT Benefits**:
- Prioritizes patches based on actual exposure and business impact
- Accounts for network segmentation in enterprise architectures
- Supports risk-based vulnerability management programs
- Enables data-driven security investment decisions
- Provides flexibility for different risk appetites across system types

**Common IT Scenarios**:
- **External systems (NE:E)**: Web servers, mail servers, VPN endpoints
- **Internal systems (NE:I)**: Databases, file servers, domain controllers  
- **Critical data (DL:C)**: Customer data, financial records, intellectual property
- **Mixed data (DL:M)**: Business applications with various data types
- **Modified thresholds**: Different policies for production vs. development environments

## 10.1. Modified Threshold Use Cases for Enterprise IT

### Challenge
Different business units and system types may require different risk assessment approaches. Some organizations need more conservative assessments for regulatory compliance, while others want to understand raw risk calculations for technical analysis.

### SSCV Solution with Modified Thresholds
**Business-Driven Risk Assessment**:
```
E-commerce Platform (Standard Assessment):
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:E/AC:F/EP:A/DL:C/PS:C
CVSS 7.2 → CRS 2.4 (Low) with 20% threshold
CVSS 7.2 → CRS 3.6~ (Low) with 50% threshold for PCI compliance
Rationale: Payment processing requires ultra-conservative risk assessment

Development Server (Technical Analysis):
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:I/AC:F/EP:A/DL:I/PS:D
CVSS 6.0 → CRS 1.2 (Low) with 20% threshold
CVSS 6.0 → CRS 0.75~ (Low) with 0% threshold for security research
Rationale: Understanding actual risk reduction impact of security controls

Corporate Email System (Regulatory Compliance):
SSCV:1.0/OS:C/NE:E/AC:F/EP:M/DL:M/PS:C
CVSS 5.8 → CRS 1.16 (Low) with 20% threshold
CVSS 5.8 → CRS 1.74~ (Low) with 30% threshold per SOX requirements
Rationale: Financial regulations mandate conservative IT risk assessment
```

**When to Use Modified Thresholds**:
- **0% threshold (~)**: Security research, understanding control effectiveness, academic analysis
- **25-35% threshold (~)**: Regulated environments (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- **40-50% threshold (~)**: Board-mandated conservative approaches, high-risk industries
- **Always document**: Business justification and approval authority for non-standard thresholds

**Benefits of Threshold Flexibility**:
- Accommodates different business unit risk appetites
- Supports regulatory and compliance requirements
- Enables technical security analysis without artificial minimums
- Maintains transparency through tilde notation
- Allows side-by-side comparison of standard vs. modified assessments

## 11. Incident Response & Forensics

### Traditional Challenge
During security incidents, teams struggle to prioritize affected systems and assess actual impact based on theoretical vulnerability scores.

### SSCV Solution
**Incident Prioritization**:
```
Affected Systems During Breach:
System A (Web Server): CVSS 8.0, CRS 8.9 (High - External + Critical Data)
System B (Air-gapped ICS): CVSS 8.0, CRS 1.6 (Low - Air-gapped + Internal Data)
System C (Database): CVSS 8.0, CRS 5.3 (Medium - Internal + Mixed Data)
System D (Conservative Assessment): CVSS 8.0, CRS 6.4~ (Medium - Modified 30% threshold)

Investigation Priority: A → C → D → B
Note: System D uses modified threshold (marked with ~) per organizational policy
```

**Incident Response Benefits**:
- Realistic impact assessment
- Resource allocation during incidents
- Stakeholder communication
- Recovery prioritization
